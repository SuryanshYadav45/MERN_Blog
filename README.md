# Steps for setting up the project: 

**1. Clone or download the repo on your local system.**
   
**2. Install all the node packages for both the frontend and backend separately using the command `npm install`.**
   
**3. Create a folder named `uploads` in the `api` folder; this is where the images of the blog will be stored.**
   
**4. Replace the database `connection string` with your `connection string`.**
   
**5. Then run `nodemon` in the terminal to start the backend servers.**
   
**6. In the frontend, run `npm start` to start the frontend.**
